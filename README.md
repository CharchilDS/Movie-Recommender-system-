# Movie-Recommender-system-

A recommendation system is a type of suggesting system which makes 
suggestions based on the user’s liking. These systems can be applied to various 
data. These systems can retrieve, and filter data based on user’s preferences to 
give suggestions or recommendations in the upcoming period. To watch a movie 
the first step is to select a movie that matches the user’s liking. Users often waste 
a lot of time selecting a movie to watch. Here comes the need for a 
recommendation system. It can recommend popular movies based on their 
rating, but what makes the system useful is its ability to recommend movies 
based on users’ liking and preferences. The purpose of this system is to search for 
content that would be interesting to an individual. Since the number of users and 
the movies are increasing day by day, computing the recommended movies list in 
a single node machine takes a very large time. When we deal with huge volumes 
of data coming from various sources and in a variety of formats as we see in the 
case of movies where there is a huge amount of data to be computed and then 
recommended to a user, it involves many aspects that must be taken into 
consideration while recommending movies to the user. Our recommending 
system uses cosine similarity which is a type of content-based filtering method to 
recommend similar movies to the user. Additional information about the 
searched movie will also be provided. The additional information includes a 
Movie Poster, an Overview of the movie, a Rating of the movie, Genres, the Run 
time of the movie, and its status which can either be released or unreleased. This 
system will also provide the user with sentiment analysis on the reviews of the 
movie. These functions of this system will prove to be very useful to the user and 
consequently save a lot of time, which the user can invest in watching the movie 
he/she likes
